Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is a critically acclaimed stealth-action game that was released in 2015. However, some players who have upgraded to Windows 11 have reported that the game does not launch or crashes on startup. This is because the game's original crack by CPY is not compatible with the new operating system. Fortunately, there is a workaround that involves using a different crack by RVTFiX and applying some patches. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to play Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain on Windows 11 with crack V3.

1. Download the game from DODI Repacks - [https://dodi-repacks.site/index.php/2021/10/10/1152-metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain-v1-15-all-dlcs-multi8-dodi-repack/](https://dodi-repacks.site/index.php/2021/10/10/1152-metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain-v1-15-all-dlcs-multi8-dodi-repack/). This version includes the game version 1.15 and all DLCs.
2. Delete all the .exe and .dll files from your game directory. These are the files that contain the CPY crack and need to be replaced.
3.

These are the files that contain some patches and updates for the game and need to be copied to your game directory as well.
5. Copy and replace all the files from both folders into your game directory. Make sure you overwrite any existing files.
